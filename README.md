## Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging computational analytics and machine learning techniques to analyze and predict **birthweight**, a crucial metric for neonatal health. The analysis aims to identify key factors influencing birthweight, assess strong correlations, and implement advanced machine learning models to derive actionable insights for improving public health outcomes.

The study employs data-driven methods to address the following:
- Identifying correlations with birthweight, including strong positive and negative relationships.
- Transforming birthweight data to evaluate improvements in correlation metrics.
- Implementing classification models to predict low birthweight and evaluate their performance.

Key deliverables include exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, multiple model implementations, and the final predictions submitted to Kaggle.
